Clone the repo and then type:

npm install

node app

Requires a Redis and MongoDB server to be running.

Technologies used include Node, Express, Redis, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.io on pub/sub channels, and distributed sessions with redis.

This was created in about a 36 hour window so there are bugs, but the real time stream on the home page, and many other features are fully operational.
